            <h2>Childhood Years</h2>
            <p>
                Here's my childhood story.<sup>1</sup>  
                I loved playing outside with my childhood friends.<sup>2</sup>  
                We played Chinese garter, piko, tagu-taguan, and many other Filipino games.<sup>3</sup>  
                It was always fun, and we never got tired of running around.<sup>4</sup>  
                We laughed, shouted, and competed with each other every day.<sup>5</sup>  
                No matter how hot or rainy it was, we always found a way to play.<sup>6</sup>  
                I still remember when it was getting darker outside, it would be time to go home.<sup>7</sup>  
                But I never wanted to stop playing.<sup>8</sup>  
                Every evening, my lolo would come looking for me.<sup>9</sup>  
                He would call me angrily, "Uwi na, Kababae mong tao, nasa labas ka pa!"<sup>10</sup>  
                The moment I saw him, I would quickly run back home.<sup>11</sup>  
                At that time, I felt mad whenever I was forced to stop playing.<sup>12</sup>  
                I thought it was unfair that I had to go home while my friends could still play.<sup>13</sup>  
                I would stomp my feet and pout, wishing I could stay outside longer.<sup>14</sup>  
                But now that I am grown up, I understand why my lolo was so strict.<sup>15</sup>  
                He was only protecting me and making sure I was safe.<sup>16</sup>  
                Looking back, those childhood moments make me smile.<sup>17</sup>  
                I miss the days when life was simple, and all I cared about was playing.<sup>18</sup>  
                The friendships I made during those years were priceless.<sup>19</sup>  
                Those memories will always stay with me.<sup>20</sup>

            <h2>Teenage Years</h2>
            <p>
                When I was in my teenage years, around 7th to 10th grade, my classmates and I would hang out together after school.<sup>1</sup>  
                We would go to KTVs or the mall, just to play in the arcades, because we had free time to do whatever we wanted.<sup>2</sup>  
                After playing, we would go out to eat and enjoy each other's company.<sup>3</sup>  
                Those were some of the best moments of my teenage years.<sup>4</sup>  
                We had so much fun.<sup>5</sup>  
                My teenage years were also filled with school competitions, such as dancing and role-playing.<sup>6</sup>  
                I was very outgoing back then, never shy to join any activity.<sup>7</sup>  
                I loved being involved in everything, whether it was dancing, acting, or just having fun with friends.<sup>8</sup>  
                Now, I can't imagine doing those things anymore.<sup>9</sup>  
                My confidence during my teenage years was something I took for granted, but now I feel different.<sup>10</sup>  
                I also joined the varsity badminton team in high school.<sup>11</sup>  
                We competed in intramurals, playing against different schools.<sup>12</sup>  
                I participated in both singles and doubles events.<sup>13</sup>  
                Sometimes we won gold, sometimes silver, and those wins made me proud.<sup>14</sup>  
                I worked hard with my teammates, and the experiences taught me a lot about teamwork.<sup>15</sup>  
                Looking back, I miss the energy and excitement of those days.<sup>16</sup>  
                I miss the competitions, the fun with friends, and the freedom to do whatever I wanted.<sup>17</sup>  
                Now, I feel like I can't do the same things I used to do.<sup>18</sup>  
                My teenage years were full of unforgettable moments that I will always remember.<sup>19</sup>  
                I learned a lot during those years, and they shaped the person I am today.<sup>20</sup>

            <h2>College Years</h2>
            <p>
                Now that I am in college, my first year was hard. <sup>2</sup> I had trouble adjusting to the new setup. <sup>3</sup> Sometimes I felt overwhelmed and wondered if I was doing things right. <sup>4</sup> I often questioned if I chose the right course. <sup>5</sup> There were times when I had breakdowns because of the pressure. <sup>6</sup> It was difficult at first, but it has become a bit easier. <sup>7</sup> I met some classmates who became my support system. <sup>8</sup> They helped me whenever I needed it. <sup>9</sup> I also learned how to manage my time better. <sup>10</sup> I now know how to balance schoolwork and free time. <sup>11</sup> College is different from high school, and I can't do the same things I used to. <sup>12</sup> I also miss going to arcades with friends, but I still try. <sup>13</sup> I've learned how to organize my time so I don't get too stressed. <sup>14</sup> I try to stay focused on my studies and make time for fun. <sup>15</sup> Being in college has taught me a lot. <sup>16</sup> It's not easy, but I'm learning how to handle it. <sup>17</sup> I still sometimes feel pressure, but I know how to deal with it now. <sup>18</sup> I've grown a lot since I started college. <sup>19</sup> Even though it's tough, I know I'm getting better at it. <sup>20</sup> My college years have been challenging, but I'm making it through.<sup>20</sup>
